# How I Self-Taught Myself Linear Algebra in a Month (w/o Calculus) ðŸ‘‹

> I recently completed MITâ€™s Linear Algebra Course taught by Gilbert Strang (aka 18.06sc). This is my review of its strengths and weaknesses. I will also be giving tips and extra resources you can use.

## Why Did I choose MIT 18.06sc?

Iâ€™ve started to get extremely interested in computer science and physics (more specifically AI and Quantum Computers). Since I was going to be taking Calculus this upcoming semester I decided to move ahead to linear algebra. This decision definitely affected me while learning linear algebra. More on that in a bit.

I looked up the best textbooks to learn linear algebra, and I saw a bunch of people recommending this course. I decided to try it out by watching the first few lectures, and I was hooked. Gilbert Strangâ€™s teaching is nothing short of incredible.

## Calculus and Differential Equations:

I know some calculus from just hearing about it, but I hadnâ€™t studied it. When it came up in 18.06sc I was lost, but I could easily still understand the rest of the lecture even when this came up. I skipped lecture 23 due to the fact that it focused on differential equations. That said, I picked up the next lecture without feeling like I missed something vital in the previous lecture.

Knowing what I know now, I wouldnâ€™t recommend taking this course before calculus ~~and differential equations~~ unless you have a good reason to. If you do, when it comes up, try to understand the linear algebra side as best as you can, if you can, and move on. Donâ€™t worry too much about it.

## Course Structure:

**Recommended Reading:** If you get the textbook required for the course (you really really really should), the course lists what sections you should read before the lecture. I did this every time, and whatever I didnâ€™t understand in the book, I understood after the lecture.

**Lecture:** The lecture (usually around 50 minutes) will tie up anything you didnâ€™t understand in the reading. Gilbert Strang walks you through the ideas in a seamless and intuitive way. If you have a solid grasp of everything before, you will be able to keep up pretty well. I preferred these lectures on 2x speed, but on the more difficult ones I did lower it to 1x speed.

**Homework:** The homework was a few questions. I felt like these questions were more so testing how well you understood it, and not for practice. I recommend doing a few problems in the book to get some extra practice in as well.

**Exams:** The exams werenâ€™t bad if youâ€™ve understood everything youâ€™ve learned for it. I used the exams to see what I did and didnâ€™t know, then afterwards I reviewed my weak spots.

**Recitation:** Personally I didnâ€™t enjoy them too much, some were bad, some where good. If you want you can skip them in my opinion.

## Time Commitment:

You can take your time since this is a self-paced course, but I went at a rate of around a lecture a day to finish it before school starts for me. It took 1â€“3 hours each day depending on the difficulty of the lesson that day. Some of the lessons were super easy because 3Blue1Brown talked about them in [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).

If you plan on learning linear algebra in a month, youâ€™ll probably be putting in 15â€“25 hours a week. I donâ€™t recommend doing it in a month like me. The reason for me going at this pace is I wanted to get it done before school started back up.

## Helpful Resources:

3Blue1Brownâ€™s [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) is a must if you want to have intuition and understand it. It makes going at a fast pace so much easier because youâ€™ll already have a visual/intuitive grasp on a bunch of topics.

Zach Star has a few videos on applications of linear algebra that are great and just interesting. [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rowWM-MijXU). [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4csuTO7UTMo). [Video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8FukKfMKCI).

Any online matrix calculator. Sometimes, if I see a pattern in matrices, I test them out in calculators. I think this helps solidify what youâ€™ve learned (and sometimes youâ€™ll see some cool patterns that were never mentioned).

A good tip is that if youâ€™re stuck, move on. You might understand it after reading a bit more or watching the lecture. If youâ€™re still stuck google, youtube, and khan academy are your friends. I never felt as if I needed anything too deep from these sources since the book and lectures did the job really well. I usually only used google to clarify things.

## Conclusion and Final Thoughts

I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn linear algebra. I recommend everyone take their time to understand all the material and work through a handful more problems in the book than just given in the homework.

An understanding of calculus and differential equations will help you in this course to gain a better appreciation and understanding for linear algebra (and calculus/differential equations).
